# feedbuzz

prototype of a survey web application in dinosaur techonology

## unused files

- display.py

was supposed to be for an ncurses look and feel, ended up becoming too complex to implement.

- wizard.py

was supposed to be for making feedbuzz a user-friendly application. i didn't work on it to keep the prototype SIMPLE.
